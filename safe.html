                There is a registered nurse is available during the regular camp hours. The nurse oversees any medication required by campers and contacts 
                parents if a child becomes ill during the camp day.
                <hr>
                <h4>Medication</h4>
                If you have any medication you need your child to take throught the day or incase they have an allergic reaction or an allergy. Please contact the nurses office
                calling the nurses office at <a href="tel:#">333-999-1111</a> or email the office at <a href="mailto:#">NursesOffice@gmail.com</a> so you are able to tell the nurses
                there when your child needs to take th medicine or incase of emergencies concerning your childs health.
                <hr>
                <h4>Attire</h4>
                Please make sure your child has the appropriate attire for the daily activities that they have signed up for. For instance if they are going to be running outside
                please have them bring/wear closed toed shoes. When your child is going swimming make sure they have their bathing suit, we do have spares but I'm positive they 
                would be more comfortable in their own cothes.
