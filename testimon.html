                “Our daughter demonstrated significant growth and maturity over 6 weeks of camp from making new friends, learning archery, 
                climbing the rock wall and swimming without her parent’s supervision. We could visibly see changes in her social skills and 
                confidence late in the summer. We are looking forward to returning next year.”

                “Driving on to the campus at Exuberant Camp is like entering a kid utopia…magical and made me feel so happy to know that my kids were 
                spending their day in such a positive and wonderful environment.”

                “Exuberant Camp is everything you could ask for in a summer program. The kids are active, happy, and challenged by new and exciting opportunities each day. 
                Exuberant Camp is a new adventure every day on beautiful, secure 40-acre campus! When I watch the videos and see the pictures on the social media sites each 
                day it makes me want to go to camp too!!!”

                “The best day camp ever. It actually makes me feel good to drop my son off there every day as he has so much fun and is so fulfilled. Fabulous and 
                enthusiastic staff and just a well-organized camp. Wouldn’t go anywhere else.”

                “This was our first time at Exuberant Camp and we absolutely loved it! My daughter came home telling us about the various activities and contests that she 
                got to do at camp. She’s shy, so we were concerned at first about having her go to a camp where she didn’t know anyone, but she made friends and 
                really liked her counselors. She also improved her swimming skills tremendously with daily pool time and swim lessons. We can’t wait to go back 
                next year!”

                “The variety of activities provided at Exuberant Camp was just what our kids needed. It is such a relief to know that they are making new friends, 
                staying active, and having fun in a safe environment. That’s exactly what summer camp should be all about.”
